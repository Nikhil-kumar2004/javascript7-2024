javascript is a : synchronous and single threaded (Default) language due to which it could had been slow but this 
js engine is not run singly rather on various runtime environments do to which we feel that it's multi
threaded.

as we have seen in execution context : execution of one line of code at a time takes place and each operation
waits for the last one to complete before executing.

Blocking Code : blocks the flow of the program -> Read file sync
Non-Blocking Code : does not blocks the flow of execution -> Read file async

e.g. when kernal/pc is reading some file the in blocking code the code doesn't do anything until reading
is done.

situation: during registration we have to wait for data to be stored at the db and then to notify the 
customer that you data is saved. so, have to write blocking code only.

-->we have usecases for blocking and non-blocking --> both are equally best.
